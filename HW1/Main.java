/**
 * Abstraction: 
 * 
 * - Program asks for input on amount of days âœ”
 * 
 * - Zookeeper object will arrive at zoo each day and execute tasks: - Zookeeper class has wake
 * animals, roll call animals, feed animals, exercise the animals, tell animals
 * to sleep - Once that's done, the zookeeper will leave (maybe de-allocate
 * memory? not sure rn what needs to be done)
 * 
 * - each action will be displayed.
 * 
 * The zookeeper methods should be defined using an abstract class called
 * ZooEmployee. Zookeeper class extends this abstract class Methods common to
 * all zoo employees should be in abstract class Zookeeper may override these
 * methods or define methods particular to self.
 * 
 * To respond to the zookeeper object methods, each animal instance must have a
 * method that corresponds to the zookeepers tasks. Strings are generated on
 * every action, and should be based on executing object's attributes, like
 * name, type, day number, etc, and not hardcoded.
 * 
 * Should demonstrate the use of overriding inherited methods byt having some
 * subclasses overide methods at each of the two levels after the animal
 * superclass
 * 
 * ie: an animal can have a default eat method, but you may define alternate
 * definitins for eat at the feline or cat level.
 * 
 * Allow for the following special case: When a dog is given the exercise
 * command by the Zookeeper, there is a 25% chance that the dog will roam
 * instead, and 30% chance it will also make noise and 40% chance it will
 * instead sleep. When a pachyderm is given an exercise command, there is a 25%
 * chance it will charge instead of roam.
 * 
 * documentation needs comments that show at least on instance of abstraction,
 * encapsulation, polymorphism, abstract class, and identity. For polymorphism,
 * all animals should be able to be called regardless of subclasses.
 * 
 * . . . there's more on the writeup but this is the coding part, not the
 * testing part.
