# OOAD Homework/Project 2

A Zoo built with OOP for CSCI-4448.

## Team Members

- **Connor Ely, Kyran Butler**

## Comments / Assumptions

- "Roaming" is used in multiple different ways during the writeup. We assumed that every instance of Roaming could instead be replaced with "exercising", therefore in the instance where a Feline decides to 'roam', we instead just call the exercise method.

## Issues

- Not really. We had a case where we created the "Turtle.java" file, and unlike all of the other files created, it did not have a frame of a Java class (every file came with the "public class {} . . . "). Upon editing this file, the markdown coloring was weird, and the Zoo couldn't recognize it as an object. We ended up deleting and remaking the file with the *exact same code* and it worked. Odd.

## Instructions to Run

- No special instructions. Just have Java ready to be ran. The Main.java in the root must be ran. The exact command that VS Code ran can be seen in 'dayatthezoo.out', but should be able to be run normally without issue.
