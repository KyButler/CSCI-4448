# OOAD Homework/Project 2

A Zoo built with OOP for CSCI-4448.

## Team Members

- **Connor Ely, Kyran Butler**

## Comments / Assumptions

- Assumptions that the Animal classes don't have to be gone in depth in the UML diagrams as stated. This means we may state that we call for an Animal to go to sleep, but not go in depth about specifically what occurs when, say, a Cat goes to sleep.
- The 1 day output is saved in "dayatthezoo.out" in the root.

## Issues

- Deciding the key differences between the UML Activity and Sequence diagram took a bit, but I believe we got the gist based on examples.

## Instructions to Run

- No special instructions. Just have Java ready to be ran. The Main.java in the root must be ran.
- The PDF with our UML diagrams is named "UMLDiagrams.pdf" and is in the root of the repo. They are in order based on the questions. Individual UML diagrams can also be found under the "UML Diagrams" folder. They're the same, so feel free to reference those in the folder if it's clearer.
- Again, the 1 day output is saved in "dayatthezoo.out" in the root.
